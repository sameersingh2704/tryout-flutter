<br>Since the time that the iOS and Android platforms exploded onto the scene a decade ago, <em>cross-platform
  development</em> has been a goal across the mobile development world. The ability to write one app for both iOS and
Android can save significant time and effort for your company and team.

There have been various tools released for cross-platform development over the years, including web-based tools such as
<em><a href="https://phonegap.com/" target="_blank">PhoneGap</a></em> from Adobe, powerful frameworks such as <em><a
    href="https://www.xamarin.com/" target="_blank">Xamarin</a></em> from Microsoft, and newer tools such as <em><a
    href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/" target="_blank">React Native</a></em> from Facebook. Each tool-set
has pros and cons and they have met with varying degrees of success in the mobile industry.

A more recent framework to enter the cross-platform arena is <em><a href="https://flutter.dev/"
    target="_blank">Flutter</a></em> from Google. Flutter features fast development cycles, fast UI rendering, unique UI
design, and native app performance on both platforms.

<h2>Introduction to Flutter</h2>
As you'll see in this tutorial, the Flutter framework is heavily built around the idea of <em>widgets</em>. In Flutter,
widgets are not used just for the views of your app, but also for entire screens and even for the app itself.

In this tutorial, you'll build a flutter app that queries the <em><a
    href="https://developer.github.com/v3/teams/members/"target="_blank">GitHub API</a></em> for team members in a GitHub organization
and displays the team member information in a scroll-able list:

    height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188637" /></a>
</center>
<br>
<!-- Added Android feature -->
You can develop the app while using the Android SDK for Android or XCode for iOS or both!

In building out the app, you'll first learn the following about Flutter:

<ul>
  <li>Setting up your development environment</li>
  <li>Creating a new project</li>
  <li>Importing files and packages</li>
  <li>Using widgets and creating your own</li>
  <li>Making network calls</li>
  <li>Showing items in a list</li>
  <li>Customizing your app with Themes</li>
</ul>
<!-- Text -->
You'll also get to know the Dart programming language as you follow along the way! :]

<h2>Let's Get Going</h2>
Flutter development can be done on Windows or macOS or Linux. While you can use any editor with the Flutter tool-chain, there are IDE plugins for <em><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/"target="_blank">IntelliJ IDEA</a></em>, <em><a
    href="https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html"target="_blank">Android Studio,</a></em> and <em><a
    href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a></em> that can ease the development cycle. We'll use the VS
Code for this tutorial.

<h2>Setting up your development environment</h2>
Instructions for setting up your development machine with the Flutter framework can be found <a
  href="https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install" target="_blank">here</a>. The basic steps vary by platform, but
for the most part, are:

<ol>
  <li>Download the installation bundle for your development machine's operating system to get the latest stable release
    of the Flutter SDK</li>
  <li>Extract the installation bundle in the desired location</li>
  <li>Add the flutter tool to your path</li>
  <li>Install missing dependencies</li>
  <li>Set up your IDE with a Flutter plugin/extension</li>
  <!-- text -->
  <li>Run <em>flutter doctor</em> command in the terminal to your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation</li>
  <li>Test drive an app</li>
</ol>

The instructions provided on the Flutter webpage are well documented and allow you to easily understand and set up a development
environment on the platform of your choice. The remainder of this tutorial assumes you've set up the VS Code for Flutter
development, and that you've addressed any issues found by <code>flutter doctor</code>.

Now you should also be able to follow along pretty well if you're using Android Studio. You'll also need to be running
either the iOS Simulator, an Android emulator, or have a provisioned iOS device or an Android device set up for
development.

<div class="note">
  <p><em>Note</em>: For building and testing on the iOS Simulator or an iOS device, you'll need to be using macOS with
    XCode installed.</p>
</div>

<h2>Creating a new project</h2>
In VS Code with the Flutter extension installed, <br>open the command palette by choosing <em>View â–º Command Palette</em>
or hitting <em>Cmd-Shift-P</em> on macOS or <em>Ctrl-Shift-P</em> on Linux or Windows. <br>Enter <em>Flutter: New Project</em> into
the palette and hit return.
<center>
  <br>
<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/newproject.png"target="_blank"><img
    src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/newproject-650x137.png" alt="New project" width="650"
    height="137" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188639" /></a>
  </center>
  <br>
Enter the name of your project and hit return. For this tutorial, we will go with <em>ghflutter</em>. <br>Select a folder to store the project in, and then wait
for Flutter to set up the project in VS Code. <br>When the project is ready, the file <em>main.dart</em> will be opened in
your editor.
<br>
<center>
  <br>
<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/projectready.png"target="_blank"><img
    src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/projectready-650x406.png" alt="Project ready"
    width="650" height="406" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188640" /></a>
  </center>
    <br>
In VS Code, you see a panel on the left-hand side that shows your project structure. There are folders for iOS and
Android, as well as a <em>lib</em> folder that contains <em>main.dart</em> and will have code that applies to both
platforms. You'll be working in the lib folder only in this tutorial.

Replace the code in main.dart with the following:

<pre lang="dart">
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(GHFlutterApp());

class GHFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget buildWidget(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'GHFlutter', //Displays text when the app is minimized
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('GHFlutter'), //Displays text at AppBar
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('GHFlutter'), //Displays text in the body
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
</pre>


The <code>main()</code> function near the top uses the <code>=></code> operator for a single line function to run the
app. You have one class for the app named <code>GHFlutterApp</code>.

You see here that your app itself is a <code>StatelessWidget</code>. Most entities in a Flutter app are
<em>widgets</em>, either stateless or stateful. You override the widget <code>build()</code> method to create your app
widget. You're using the <em>MaterialApp</em> widget that provides a number of components needed for apps following
Material Design.

For this getting started tutorial, remove the test file widget_test.dart in the <code>test</code> folder from the
project by right-clicking, selecting the Delete option, and then confirming the deletion.
<br>
<center>
  <br>
<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2019/07/ghflutter_deletetest.png"target="_blank"><img
    src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2019/07/ghflutter_deletetest-486x500.png" alt="" width="486"
    height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-229688" /></a>
  </center>
  <br>
If you're on macOS, startup the iOS simulator. You can also use the Android Simulator on macOS, Linux, or Windows. If both
the iOS Simulator and an Android emulator are running, you can switch between them using the menu in the bottom right of
the VS Code window:
<br>
<center><br>
<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/switchdevices.png"target="_blank"><img
    src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/switchdevices-650x406.png" alt="Switch devices"
    width="650" height="406" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188641" /></a>
  </center>
  <br>
To build and run the project, we will need to setup a launch configuration first.

Switch to Debug View, by clicking on the crossed bug icon on the left side panel.
<br><center><br>
<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2019/07/ghflutter_debugpanel.png"target="_blank"><img
    src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2019/07/ghflutter_debugpanel-607x500.png" alt="" width="607"
    height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-229689" /></a>
  </center>
  <br>
You will notice there is no configuration defined as of now. Click on "No Configuration" to get the dropdown and select
"Add Configuration".
<br><center><br>
<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2019/07/ghflutter_addconfig.png"target="_blank"><img
    src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2019/07/ghflutter_addconfig-650x108.png" alt="" width="650"
    height="108" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-229690" /></a>
  </center>
  <br>
VS Code will create a launch.json file with the details as below:
<br>
<center><br>
<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2019/07/ghflutter_launchjson.png"target="_blank"><img
    src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2019/07/ghflutter_launchjson-650x199.png" alt="" width="650"
    height="199" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-229691" /></a>
  </center>
  <br>
<div class="note">
  <p><em>Note</em>: This file is auto-generated for you when you choose the <em>Add Configuration</em> item. You shouldn't
    need to modify it for this tutorial.</p>
</div>

You are all set up now, build and run the project by hitting <em>F5</em> or choosing Debug â–º Start Debugging or hitting
the green play icon. You'll see the <em>Debug Console</em> open and, if running on iOS, you'll see XCode being used to
build the project. If running on Android, you'll see Gradle being invoked to do the build.

You can stop the running app by clicking the stop button on the right of the toolbar at the top of the VS Code window:
<br><center><br>
<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/toolbar.png"target="_blank"><img
    src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/toolbar-650x156.png" alt="The VS Code toolbar"
    width="650" height="156" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188644" /></a>
  </center>
  <br>
You can get back to the project view by clicking the icon in the upper left of the VS Code or choosing <em>View â–º
  Explorer</em>.

<h2>Hot Reload</h2>
One of the best aspects of Flutter development is being able to <em>hot reload</em> your app as you make changes. This
is similar to something like Android Studio's <em>Instant Run/Apply Changes</em>.

Build and run the app so that its running on the Simulator or an emulator:
<br><center><br>
<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/firstandroidrun-1.png"><img
    src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/firstandroidrun-1-281x500.png" alt="Before hot reload"
    width="281" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188645" /></a>
  </center>
  <br>
Now, without stopping the running app, change the app bar string to something else:

<pre lang="dart">
appBar: AppBar(
  title: Text('GHFlutter App'), //Displays text at AppBar
),
</pre>


Now click the hot reload button on the toolbar or simply save the <em>main.dart</em> file:
<br>
<center><br>
<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/hotreloadbutton.png"target="_blank"><img
    src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/hotreloadbutton-650x156.png" alt="Hot reload button"
    width="650" height="156" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188646" /></a>
  </center>
  <br>
Within a second or two you should see the change reflected in the running app:
<br><center><br>
<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/hotreload.png"target="_blank"><img
    src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/hotreload-281x500.png" alt="After hot reload"
    width="281" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188647" /></a>
  </center>
  <br>
The hot reload feature may not always work and the <a
  href="https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/hot-reload"target="_blank">official docs</a> do a really nice job of explaining the
cases where it does not work, but overall it's a great time saver when you're building out your UI.

<h2>Importing a File</h2>
Rather than keep all your Dart code in the single <i>main.dart</i> file, you'll want to be able to import code from
other classes you create. You'll see an example now for importing strings, which will help when you need to localize
your user-facing strings.

Create a file named strings.dart in the lib folder by right-clicking on <em>lib</em> and choosing <em>New File</em>:
<br>
<center><br>
<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/newfile.png"target="_blank"><img
    src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/newfile-371x500.png" alt="Creating a new file"
    width="371" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188648" /></a>
  </center>
  <br>
Add the following class to the new file:

<pre lang="dart">
class Strings {
  static String appTitle = "GHFlutter"; //Initializing a variable with a String for future use
}
</pre>


Add the following import to the top of <em>main.dart</em>

<pre lang="dart">
import 'strings.dart';
</pre>


Change your widget to use the new strings class so that the <code>GHFlutterApp</code> class looks as follows:

<pre lang="dart">
class GHFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: Strings.appTitle, //Displays text when the app is minimized from a variable of Strings class
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text(Strings.appTitle), //Displays text at AppBar from a variable of Strings class
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(Strings.appTitle), //Displays text in the body from a variable of Strings class
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
</pre>

Build and run the app by hitting F11, and you should see no change, but you're now using strings from the strings file.

<h2>Widgets</h2>
Almost every element of your Flutter app is a widget. Widgets are designed to be <em>immutable</em>, since using
immutable widgets helps keep the app UI lightweight.

There are two fundamental types of widgets you will use:

<ul>
  <li><em>Stateless</em>: widgets that depend only upon their own configuration info, such as a static image in an image
    view.</li>
  <li><em>Stateful</em>: widgets that need to maintain dynamic information and do so by interacting with a
    <em>State</em> object.</li>
</ul>

Both stateless and stateful widgets redraw in Flutter apps on every frame, the difference being that the stateful
widgets delegate their configuration to a <em>State</em> object.

To get started with making your own widgets, create a new class at the bottom of <em>main.dart</em>:

<pre lang="dart">
class GHFlutter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  createState() => GHFlutterState(); //Framework can call this method multiple times over the lifetime of a StatefulWidget
}
</pre>

You've made a <code>StatefulWidget</code> subclass and you're overriding the <code>createState()</code> method to create
its state object. Now add a <code>GHFlutterState</code> class above <code>GHFlutter</code>:

<pre lang="dart">
class GHFlutterState extends State<GHFlutter> { //Stores the mutable data that can change over the lifetime of the widget
}
</pre>

<code>GHFlutterState</code> extends <code>StatefulWidget</code> with a parameter of <code>GHFlutter</code>.

The primary task you have when making a new widget is to override the <code>build()</code> method that gets called when
the widget is rendered to the screen.

Add a <code>build()</code> override to <code>GHFlutterState</code>:

<pre lang="dart">
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
â€‹    
}
</pre>

Fill out <code>build()</code> as follows:

<pre lang="dart">
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold (
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text(Strings.appTitle),
    ),
    body: Text(Strings.appTitle),
  );
}
</pre>

A <em>Scaffold</em> is a container for material design widgets. It acts as the root of a widget hierarchy. You've added
an <code>AppBar</code> and a <code>body</code> to the scaffold, and each contains a <code>Text</code> widget.

Update <code>GHFlutterApp</code> so that it uses your new <code>GHFlutter</code> widget as its <code>home</code>
attribute, instead of building a scaffold of it's own:

<pre lang="dart">
class GHFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: Strings.appTitle,
      home: GHFlutter(), //Calling GHFlutter class
    );
  }
}
</pre>

Build and run the app, and you'll see a new widget in action:
<br>
<center><br>
<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/ghflutterwidget.png"target="_blank"><img
    src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/ghflutterwidget-281x500.png"
    alt="Using GHFlutter Widget" width="281" height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188649" /></a>
  </center>
  <br>
Not much has changed yet, but now you're set up to build out the new widget.

<h2>Making Network Calls</h2>
Earlier you imported your <em>strings.dart</em> file into the project. You can similarly import other packages that are
part of the Flutter framework and Dart.

For example, you'll now use packages available in the framework to make an HTTP network call and also parse the
resulting response JSON into Dart objects. Add two new imports at the top of <em>main.dart</em>:

<pre lang="dart">
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
</pre>

You will notice the http package is not available. That is because it is not added to the project yet. Navigate to the
<em>pubspec.yaml</em> file and right under `dependencies` and `cupertino_icons: ^0.1.2` add the below:
<pre lang="yaml">
  cupertino_icons: ^0.1.2

  # HTTP package
â€‹  http: ^0.12.0+2
</pre>

<div class="note">
  <p><em>Note</em>: Notice the indentation. Maintain the indentation of the http package declaration to be the same as
    that of the cupertino_icons package.</p>
</div>
Now, when you save your <em>pubspec.yaml</em> file, the Flutter extension in VS Code will run the
<code>flutter pub get</code> command. Flutter will get the declared <em>http</em> package and your package will be
available in <em>main.dart</em> also.

You'll now see an indicator in <em>main.dart</em> on the imports that are currently unused.

Dart apps are single-threaded, but Dart provides support for running code on other threads as well as running
asynchronous code that does not block the UI thread using an <em>async/await</em> pattern.

You're going to make an asynchronous network call to retrieve a list of GitHub team members. Add an empty list as a
property at the top of <code>GHFlutterState</code>, and also add a property to hold a text style:

<pre lang="dart">
var _members = [];

final _biggerFont = const TextStyle(fontSize: 18.0); //Using TextStyle widget to increase font size
</pre>

The underscores at the beginning of the names make the members of the class <em>private</em>.

To make the asynchronous HTTP call, add a method <code>_loadData()</code> to <code>GHFlutterState</code>:

<pre lang="dart">
_loadData() async {
  String dataURL = "https://api.github.com/orgs/raywenderlich/members"; //Initializing the API URL
  http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL); //Using await to wait till the data is fetched
  setState(() {
    _members = json.decode(response.body); //Decoding and assigning data in the json format
  });
}
</pre>

We added the <code>async</code> keyword onto <code>_loadData()</code> to tell Dart that it's asynchronous, and also the
<code>await</code> keyword on the <code>http.get()</code> call that is blocking. You're using a <code>dataUrl</code>
value that is set to the GitHub API endpoint that retrieves members for a GitHub organization.

When the HTTP call completes, we pass a callback to <code>setState()</code> that runs synchronously on the UI thread. In
this case, you are decoding the JSON response and assigning it to the <code>_members</code> list.

Add an <code>initState()</code> override to <code>GHFlutterState</code> that calls <code>_loadData()</code> when the
state is initialized:

<pre lang="dart">
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState(); //Called once when the stateful widget is inserted in the widget tree.

  _loadData();
}
</pre>

<h2>Using a ListView</h2>
Now that you have a Dart list of members, you need a way to display them in a list in the UI. Dart provides a
<em>ListView</em> widget that will let you show the data in a list. ListView acts like a <em>RecyclerView</em> on
Android and a <em>UITableView</em> on iOS, recycling views as the user scrolls through the list to achieve smooth
scrolling performance.

Add a <code>_buildRow()</code> method to <code>GHFlutterState</code>:

<pre lang="dart">
Widget _buildRow(int i) {
  return ListTile(
    title: Text("${_members[i]["login"]}", style: _biggerFont) //Using index value to fetch data
  );
}
</pre>

You are returning a <em>ListTile</em> widget that shows the "login" value parsed from the JSON for the ith member, and
also using the text style you created before.

Update the build method of <code>GHFlutterState</code> to have it's body be a <em>ListView.builder</em>:

<pre lang="dart">
body: ListView.builder( //It takes two recommended arguments i.e. itemCount and itemBuilder
  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0), //Padding on all edges
  itemCount: _members.length, //Number of items in the json file
  itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int position) {
    return _buildRow(position);
  }),
</pre>

You've added padding, set the <code>itemCount</code> to the number of members, and set the <code>itemBuilder</code>
using <code>_buildRow()</code> for a given position.

You can try a hot reload, but you may get a "Full restart may be required" message. If so, hit F5 to build and run the
app:
<br><center><br>
<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/members.png"target="_blank"><img
    src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/members-281x500.png" alt="Showing members" width="281"
    height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188650" /></a>
  </center>
  <br>
That's just how easy it is to make a network call, parse the data, and show the results in a list!
<br><center><br>
<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/easy-1.png"target="_blank"><img
    src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/easy-1-320x320.png" alt="Wow so easy" width="320"
    height="320" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-188653" /></a>
  </center>
  <br>
<h2>Adding dividers</h2>
To add dividers into the list, you're going to double the item count, and then return a <em>Divider</em> widget when the
position in the list is odd. Update the build method of <code>GHFlutterState</code> as below:

<pre lang="dart">
body: ListView.builder(
  itemCount: _members.length * 2,
  itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int position) {
    if (position.isOdd) return Divider();

    final index = position ~/ 2;
    
    return _buildRow(index);
  }),
</pre>

Be sure that you do not to miss the * 2 on <code>itemCount</code>. We've removed the padding from the builder now that we have dividers.
In <code>itemBuilder</code>, you're either returning a <code>Divider()</code>, or instead calculating a new index by
integer division and using <code>_buildRow()</code> to build a row item.

Try a hot reload and you should see dividers on the list:
<br><center><br>
<a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/dividers.png"target="_blank"><img
    src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2018/03/dividers-281x500.png" alt="With dividers" width="281"
    height="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-188654" /></a>
  </center>
  <br>
To add padding back into each row, you want to use a <code>Padding</code> widget within _buildRow():

<pre lang="dart">
Widget _buildRow(int i) {
  return Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
    child: ListTile(
      title: Text("${_members[i]["login"]}", style: _biggerFont)
    )
  );
}
</pre>

The <code>ListTile</code> is now a child widget of the padding widget. Hot reload to see the padding on the rows but not
on the dividers.

<h2>Parsing to custom types</h2>
In the previous section, the JSON parser took each member in the JSON response and added it to the <code>_members</code>
list as a Dart <em>Map</em> type, the equivalent of a <em>Map</em> in Kotlin or a <em>Dictionary</em> in Swift.

However, you'll also want to be able to use your custom types.

Add a new <code>Member</code> type to the main.dart file:

<pre lang="dart">
  class Member {
    final String login;

    Member(this.login) {
      if (login == null) {
        throw ArgumentError("login of Member cannot be null. "
            "Received: '$login'");
      }
    }
  }
</pre>

A member has a login property and a constructor that throws an error if the login value is null.

Update the <code>_members</code> declaration in <code>GHFlutterState</code> so that it is a list of <code>Member</code>
objects:

<pre lang="dart">
  var _members = <Member>[];
</pre>

Update <code>_buildRow()</code> to use the <code>login</code> property on the <code>Member</code> object instead of
using the "login" key on the map:

<pre lang="dart">
  title: Text("${_members[i].login}", style: _biggerFont)
</pre>

Now update the callback sent to setState() in <code>_loadData()</code> to turn the decoded map into a
<code>Member</code> object and add it to the list of members:

<pre lang="dart">
  setState(() {
    final membersJSON = json.decode(response.body);

    for (var memberJSON in membersJSON) {
      final member = Member(memberJSON["login"]);
      _members.add(member);
    }
  });
</pre>

You'll likely see an error if you try a hot reload, but stop and hit F5 to build and run the app and you should see the
same screen as before, except now using your new <code>Member</code> class.

<h2>Downloading Images with NetworkImage</h2>
Each member from GitHub has a URL for their avatar. You'll now add that avatar to the <code>Member</code> class and show
the avatars in the app.

Update the Member class to add an <code>avatarUrl</code> property that cannot be null:

<pre lang="dart">
  class Member {
    final String login;
    final String avatarUrl;
  
    Member(this.login, this.avatarUrl) {
      if (login == null) {
        throw new ArgumentError(
            "login member cannot be null. Received: '$login'");
      }
  
      if (avatarUrl == null) {
        throw new ArgumentError(
            "avatarUrl of Member cannot be null.Received: '$avatarUrl'");
      }
    }
  }
</pre>

Update <code>_buildRow()</code> to show the avatar using a <em>NetworkImage</em> and the <em>CircleAvatar</em> widget:

<pre lang="dart">
Widget _buildRow(int i) {
  return Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
    child: ListTile(
      title: Text("${_members[i].login}", style: _biggerFont),
      leading: CircleAvatar(
        backgroundColor: Colors.green,
        backgroundImage: NetworkImage(_members[i].avatarUrl)
      ),
    )
  );
}
</pre>

By setting the avatar as the <code>leading</code> attribute of the <code>ListTile</code>, it will show before the title
within the row. You've also set a background color on the image using the <code>Colors</code> class.

Now update <code>_loadData()</code> to use the "avatar_url" value in the map when creating a new <code>Member</code>:

<pre lang="dart">
final member = Member(memberJSON["login"], memberJSON["avatar_url"]);
</pre>

Stop, build, and run the app using F5. You'll see your member avatars now shown in each row:

  </center>

<h2>Cleaning the code</h2>
Most of your code is now in the <em>main.dart</em> file. To make the code a little cleaner, you can refactor the widget
and other classes you've added into their files.

Create files named <i>member.dart</i> and <em>ghflutter.dart</em> in the <em>lib</em> folder. Move the
<code>Member</code> class into <em>member.dart</em> and both the <code>GHFlutterState</code> and <code>GHFlutter</code>
classes into <em>ghflutter.dart</em>.

You won't need any <code>import</code> statement in <em>member.dart</em>, but the imports in <em>ghflutter.dart</em>
should be as follows:

<pre lang="dart">
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'member.dart';
import 'strings.dart'; 
</pre>

You also need to update the imports in the <em>main.dart</em>, so that the entire file consists of the following:

<pre lang="dart">
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'ghflutter.dart';
import 'strings.dart';

void main() => runApp(GHFlutterApp());


class GHFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: Strings.appTitle,
      home: GHFlutter(), //Calling GHFlutter class
    );
  }
}  
</pre>

Build and run the app by hitting F5 and you should see no change, but the code is now a little cleaner. :]

<h2>Adding a Theme</h2>
You can easily add a theme to the app by adding a <em>theme</em> attribute to the <code>MaterialApp</code> you create in
<em>main.dart</em>:

<pre lang="dart">
class GHFlutterApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: Strings.appTitle,
      theme: ThemeData(primaryColor: Colors.green.shade800), //Adding theme color to the app
      home: GHFlutter(), //Calling GHFlutter class
    );
  }
}  
</pre>

You're using a shade of green as a Material Design color value for the theme.

Build and run the app by hitting F5 to see the new theme in action.

<h2>Where to Go from here?</h2>
You should be able to open the final project in either VS Code or Android Studio. Open in VS Code by just opening the
root folder. You'll need to fetch packages before running the project. Do so by opening the command palette with
<em>Cmd+Shift+P</em> and running the <em>Flutter: Get Packages</em> command.

To open the final project in Android Studio, choose <em>Open an existing Android Studio project</em> from the
<em>Welcome to Android Studio</em> screen and navigate to choose the root folder of the final project. You'll need to
then choose "Open Flutter Settings" (or go to <em>Preferences</em> and search on "Flutter") and set the Flutter SDK path
to where you cloned the flutter git repo. If needed, then choose "Get dependencies" on the "'Packages get has not been
run" line in Android Studio. Choose the <em>Project</em> view in the project panel to see your files.

If you're on macOS, you can run the app from Android Studio to either an Android emulator or the iOS Simulator. Try it,
it's pretty cool! :]
