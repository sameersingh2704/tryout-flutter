Note: The Flutter Tech Editor tryout project is an end project and not a begin project, since the associated mock article builds the project from scratch. You should send the edited end project to the recruiter instead of the begin project.

For your Flutter TE tryout, you should make sure that the end project builds and runs correctly, from either Visual Studio Code or Android Studio, or, even better, both. :]
